- Redesigned so that 'light strip' is along the bottom.
    - This should make the glow along this strip much brighter; Before, the light strip began at a similiar height as the LEDS, now it is below.
- Can be printed in 2 seperate pieces now, with no filament swaps needed to achieve a 2 color case.
    - Filament swaps can be a tad annoying.
    - If you're printing in wood filament and wish to stain/paint the wood portions, it's much easier to post process the wood part now that its a seperate piece instead of a different filament on 1 part.
    - Pegs used for friction fit would snap easily, and warping could cause gaps in the case.
    - Screws together now, so whole thing should be more solid and like one piece
