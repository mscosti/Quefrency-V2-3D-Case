![Adjustable Keyboard Foot](images/keyboard_foot_test.jpg "V2 Fusion Render")
### Adjustable Keyboard Feet
- Added CAD and STL files for simple adjustable foot part.
- M3 screw of any length fits in tightly to cut cone piece.
- M3 nut can be inserted into up to 4 slots on each case, 2 in front, 2 in back
    - Add legs to back to get typical keyboard leg tilt
    - Add legs to front to get negative tilt
    - Add to sides to get tenting
    - Experiment with adding different length screws to each of the 4 to get the most comfortable tilt/tent angle for you.
- screw + foot can be screwed into these holes.
    - Length is variable on screw height and by how much you tighten the screw
    - Should get about ~5mm of adjustment.
- Optionally add a small rubber dome to the end for extra height and grip on desk

### Case Redesign
- Redesigned so that 'light strip' is along the bottom.
    - This should make the glow along this strip much brighter; Before, the light strip began at a similiar height as the LEDS, now it is below.
- Can be printed in 2 seperate pieces now, with no filament swaps needed to achieve a 2 color case.
    - Filament swaps can be a tad annoying.
    - If you're printing in wood filament and wish to stain/paint the wood portions, it's much easier to post process the wood part now that its a seperate piece instead of a different filament on 1 part.
    - Pegs used for friction fit would snap easily, and warping could cause gaps in the case.
    - Screws together now, so whole thing should be more solid and like one piece

### Initial Release

- 'light strip' is a thin white section in the middle of the case
- Printed in 4 filament swaps
- left side of the case has top section that friction fits onto the rest of the case, after PCB installed
